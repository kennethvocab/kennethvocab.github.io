🌟 I am currently a first-year PhD student in Second Language Studies at Michigan State University (USA). I received my MSc in Applied Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition with Distinction in Overall and Thesis from University of Oxford (UK). Prior to starting my PhD journey, I worked as a full-time research assistant on funded projects at the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.

👨‍🎓 My research interests:
- Vocabulary acquisition
-	Formulaic sequences
- Psycholinguistics
- Technology-enhanced language learning/CALL
- Lexical processing

I am particularly interested in using experiments with 🧠 psycholinguistic measures of reaction times (RTs) and eye-tracking to examine the cognitive mechanisms of vocabulary acquisition.
