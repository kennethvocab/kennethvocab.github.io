🌟 Bio:<br><br>
My name is W. Y. Kenneth Li. I am currently a fully-funded PhD student in Second Language Studies at Michigan State University (USA)🇺🇸. I received my MSc in Applied Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition with Distinction in Overall and Thesis from University of Oxford (UK)🇬🇧. Prior to starting my PhD journey, I worked as a full-time research assistant on funded projects at the University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong)🇭🇰.

👨‍🎓 Research interests:
- Vocabulary acquisition
-	Formulaic sequences
- Psycholinguistics
- Second language processing
- Technology-enhanced language learning/CALL

I am particularly interested in using experiments with 🧠 psycholinguistic measures of reaction times (RTs) and eye-tracking to examine the cognitive mechanisms of vocabulary acquisition.
